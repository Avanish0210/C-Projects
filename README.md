### 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++
A simple 2-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using C++. This project helped me understand core programming concepts like arrays, functions, input validation, and control flow in a fun and interactive way.

📌 Features
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 2-player game (Player X vs Player O)
🖥️ Console-based board rendering
✅ Valid move checking
🏆 Win and draw detection logic
🔁 Game loop until completion

## 🛠 How to Compile and Run

### 🧾 Requirements:
- GCC / g++ compiler
- Command line terminal

### ▶️ Compile:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output_name
./output_name      # For Linux/Mac
output_name.exe    # For Windows
g++ student_management.cpp -o student_management
./student_management
